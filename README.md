Type: Algorithm, Mathematics

I found this kata <1 kyu> ["square sums"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a667236145c462103000091) on codewars.

I tried to figure out my own mathematical solution so far. At least I've been practicing some interesting programming techniques in java.
Working with different types of collections and streams. 
Still working on this approach.
